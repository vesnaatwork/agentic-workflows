=== Final Comprehensive Project Plan ===

--- User Stories ---
As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to reduce my workload on routine inquiries so that I can focus on resolving complex customer issues efficiently.

As an SME (Subject Matter Expert), I expect the Email Router to only forward relevant and complex inquiries to me, improving my efficiency and job satisfaction.

As an IT Administrator, I need the Email Router system to seamlessly integrate with our existing email platforms without disrupting current workflows to ensure smooth system configuration, maintenance, and performance monitoring.

--- Product Features ---
Based on the provided user stories, the product features for the Email Router system can be organized into the following cohesive groups:

1. Automation and Workload Reduction:
- Automatically categorize and handle routine inquiries to reduce the workload of Customer Support Representatives.
- Forward only relevant and complex inquiries to Subject Matter Experts for efficient handling.

2. Integration and Compatibility:
- Seamless integration with existing email platforms using SMTP, IMAP, and RESTful APIs to ensure smooth operation and minimal disruption to workflows.

3. Performance Monitoring and Reporting:
